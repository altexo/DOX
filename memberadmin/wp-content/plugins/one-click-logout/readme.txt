simplifies logging out of the wordpress dashboard to a single one click logout
== Description ==
simplifies logging out of the wordpress dashboard to a single one click logout

In the WordPress Dashboard, in the upper right corner, one must open and hover through a dropdown menu to logout, which in the minds of some is equivalent to two clicks of a mouse. TWO CLICKS! To enhance the ease of use, this simple plugin alters the logout to occur with a single click.

Generally:

No more maneuvering through annoying dropdown menus.

One click and you're out!

Features:

* Creates a simple one click logout for the WordPress Dashboard.
* Simplifies and drops user profile link.

For one click logout but without the admin bar, remove it using the [Admin Bar Removal](//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-admin-bar-removal/) plugin by sLa, in conjunction with a forked version of this plugin: [One Click Logout Barless](//wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-logout-barless/), thus restoring a WP 3.2-like header AND one click logout. Or try a fusion of them with [ToolBar Removal](//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-toolbar-removal/). With all of the above, one click and you're out.
